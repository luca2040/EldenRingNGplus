# Elden Ring NG+ editor

This mod lets you change the current level of New Game Plus.

### Usage

To use this mod simply press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and a window asking for the new NG+ level will appear. Then type in the box the number you want to change it to and press the OK button.

**Notes:**
- To edit the NG+ level, you must already be in the game (not in the main menu) and the change will affect ONLY the selected character. Also, the changes will take effect immediately without needing to reload anything.
- When using the game in the fullscreen mode, the NG+ window may appear under the game and you will have to select it manually.
- This mod does NOT change the game's logic, so **any NG+ level over 7 won't make any more difference**.

### Install

This is a DLL mod, this means that you can install it with whatever modloader you like that supports DLL mods.

The simplest way is to use [Elden Mod Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/117) and put this mod in its `mods` folder following the instructions on the modloader's page.

Another way is using [ModEngine2](https://github.com/soulsmods/ModEngine2/) (or [me3](https://github.com/garyttierney/me3)) and follow the relative instructions for the DLL mod installation.<br/>
On ModEngine2 you just need to put the DLL name in the config file for Elden Ring after moving the mod in the ModEngine2 folder.

### Compatibility

This mod is completely compatible with Seamless Coop and should be compatible with any other mods.
